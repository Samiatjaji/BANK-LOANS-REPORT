BACK STORY
# Introduction 
This is an excel project on a bank loan data. This project is to analyse and derive insights to answer critical questions and allow these Insights/answers provided to be used to make better decisions going forward as a bank.

# Dataset used
The dataset was downloaded from kaggle. Download [here](https://github.com/Samiatjaji/BANK-LOANS-REPORT/blob/main/financial_loan.csv)

# Data Analysis process
A series of steps must be carried out to interpret this information. The steps u used in this process are listed below:
- Excel concept applied
- Problem Statement 
- Data Cleaning Process
- Visualisation 
- Communication and insights


## Excel concepts applied are 



## Problem Statement 
To analyse this data I would like to highlight the main focus, reasons and questions I will be answering with the data analysis process, to gain a comprehensive overview of the bank's lending operations and monitor the performance of loans.  
This analysis will focus on:
### Primary KPIs,  Month over Month (MoM) and  Month to Date (MTD) changes 
- Total loan Applications
- Total funded amount 
- Total amount received 
- Average interest rate 
- Average Debt to income ratio (DTI)
- Good Loans vs Bad Loans

### Secondary KPIs
- Monthly Trends by Issue date
- Regional analysis by state
- Loan term analysis 
- Employee length
- Loan purpose 
- Home ownership analysis 

## Data Cleaning Process 
The dataset used was a clean one. I had to convert from a csv to xlx file and created a pivot table to start visualizing it. I also created a new column and used the IF( OR) statement to categorise the loan status into good or bad loans.

All further analysis are in the design sheets of the interactive [dashboard](https://github.com/Samiatjaji/BANK-LOANS-REPORT/blob/main/Dashboard%20Analysis.xlsx)


## Visualisation
I created a grid view report categorised by 'Loan status' in order to get a completely cover the data and hence enforce the right decisions on the bank's health Portfolio. 

### Summary Dashboard 

![Summary Report](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1d58ba5-8213-4a33-ae78-0ee9592a0018)

At the top, KPIs such as total applications, total funded amount, total amount received, average interest rate and average DTI are displayed alongside their month-over-month and month-to-date changes showing performance trends.

![KPIs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf916956-e5cc-4e6f-8400-1e447a614fd2)


- The total loan application is 38.6K with a month-over-month increase of 6.9% and month-to-date of 4.3K application. This indicates an positive trend in loan demand and that the bank is actively attracting new loan applicants.
- The total funded amount by the bank is $435.8M with MoM increase of 13% and MTD of $54.0M. This shows that the bank is succesffully approving and funding a significant portion of loan applications.
- The total amount received is $473.1M with MoM increase of 15.8% and MTD of $58.1M shows that repayments are coming in at a healthy pace
- The average Interest rate is 12.05% with MoM increase of 3.5% and MTD of 12.36%
- The Average Debt-to-income ratio is 13.33% with MoM increase of 2.7% and MTD of 13.67% further suggests that borrowers may have a relatively high level of existing debt. This could pose a risk to loan repayment.

- Good Loans Issued vs Bad Loans Issued

![Good Bad loans](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a58867b-3dbe-4e84-aa32-39b6c26b4d55)

Out of the Total Applications of loans approved, 86.18% of them were good loans (i.e a payment plan has been paid fully or still ongoing). This is 33.2K of total applications and funded amount is $370.2M while the amount received is $435.8M.  This shows that adequate requirements and practices are being followed to ensure repayment of loans.
Meanwhile, Bad Loans (5.3K applications) only amount to 13.82% of the total applications where $65.5M applications were funded and $37.3M was received back.This is low compared to good loans but its still a potential area for risk management improvement. 


- Secondary KPIs

![Fully paid etc](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ceef71d-2843-4650-9cb5-486fd7d65290)

The dashboard provides a breakdown of loan performance based on the loan status. Majority of loan applications have been fully paid off indicating a positive trend while a smaller portion have been charged off and some loans are currently active and being repaid.
