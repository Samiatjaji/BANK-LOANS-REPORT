BACK STORY
# Introduction 
This is an excel project on a bank loan data. This project is to analyse and derive insights to answer critical questions and allow these Insights/answers provided to be used to make better decisions going forward as a bank.

# Dataset used
The dataset was downloaded from kaggle. Download here PICTURE

# Data Analysis process
A series of steps must be carried out to interpret this information. The steps u used in this process are listed below:
- Excel concept applied
- Problem Statement 
- Data Cleaning Process
- Visualisation 
- Communication and insights


## Excel concepts applied are 



## Problem Statement 
To analyse this data I would like to highlight the main focus, reasons and questions I will be answering with the data analysis process, to gain a comprehensive overview of the bank's lending operations and monitor the performance of loans.  
This analysis will focus on:
### Primary KPIs,  Month over Month (MoM) and  Month to Date (MTD) changes 
-  Total loan Applications
- Total funded amount 
- Total amount received 
- Average interest rate 
- Average Debt to income ratio (DTI)
- Good Loans vs Bad Loans

### Secondary KPIs
- Monthly Trends by Issue date
- Regional analysis by state
- Loan term analysis 
- Employee length
- Loan purpose 
- Home ownership analysis 

## Data Cleaning Process 
The dataset used was a clean one. I had to convert from a csv to xlx file and created a pivot table to start visualizing it. I also created a new column and used the IF( OR) statement to categorise the loan status into good or bad loans. PICTURE




All further analysis are in the design sheets of the interactive dashboard. LINK








## Visualisation
I created a grid view report categorised by 'Loan status' in order to get a completely cover the data and hence enforce the right decisions on the bank's health Portfolio. 

### Summary Dashboard 
At the top, KPIs such as total applications, total funded amount, total amount received, average interest rate and average DTI are displayed alongside their month-over-month and month-to-date changes showing performance trends.
- The total loan application is 38.6K with a month-over-month increase of 6.9% and month-to-date of 4.3K application.
- The total funded amount by the bank is $435.8M with MoM increase of 13% and MTD of $54M 
- The total amount received is $473.1M with MoM increase of 15.8% and MTD of $58.1M 
- The average Interest rate is 12.05% with MoM increase of 3.5% and MTD of 12.36%
- The Average Debt-to-income ratio is 13.33% with MoM increase of 2.7% and MTD of 13.67%

- Good Loans Issued vs Bad Loans Issued
Out of the Total Applications of loans approved, 86.18% of them were good loans (i.e a payment plan has been paid fully or still ongoing). This is 33.2K of total applications and funded amount is $370.2M while the amount received is $435.8M.  This shows that adequate requirements and practices are being followed to ensure repayment of loans.
Meanwhile, Bad Loans (5.3K) only amount to 13.82% of the total applications where $65.5M applications were funded and $37.3M was received back.
